description:
  The 1EDCxxI12AH and 1EDCxxH12AH are galvanically isolated single channel IGBT driver in a
  PG-DSO-8-59 package that provide output currents up to 10 A at separated output pins.

  The input logic pins operate on a wide input voltage range from 3 V to 15 V using scaled CMOS
  threshold levels to support even 3.3 V microcontrollers.

  Data transfer across the isolation barrier is realized by the coreless transformer technology.

  Every driver family member comes with logic input and driver output undervoltage lockout (UVLO)
  and active shutdown.
pins:
  1 :
    name: VCC1
    function: Positive logic supply
  2:
    name: IN+
    function: Non-inverted driver input (active high)
  3:
    name: IN-
    function: Inverted driver input (active low)
  4:
    name: GND1
    function: Logic ground
  5:
    name: GND2
    function: Power ground
  6:
    name: VCC2
    function: Positive power supply output side
  7:
    name: OUT+
    function: Driver source output
  8:
    name: OUT-
    function: Driver sink output
implementation:
  - bypass VCC1 to GND1 with 100n capacitor
  - bypass positive +15V VCC2 to IGBT Emitter with 1u capacitor
  - bypass negative  -8V GND2 to IGBT Emitter with 1u capacitor
  - use a 10R for source resistor (OUT+ to Gate)
  - use a 3R3 for sink resistor (OUT- to Gate)
pcb implementation:
 - Sufficient spacing should be kept between high voltage isolated side and low voltage side circuits.
 - The same minimum distance between two adjacent high-side isolated parts of the PCB should be
   maintained to increase the effective isolation and to reduce parasitic coupling.
 - In order to ensure low supply ripple and clean switching signals, bypass capacitor trace lengths
   should be kept as short as possible.
